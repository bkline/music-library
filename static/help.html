        To log into the catalog application, connect to its
        <a href="https://ml.rksystems.com/library" target="_blank">address</a>
        using your browser, enter the account name and password,
        and click the <strong>Login</strong> button.
        You will see a page which you can use to browse the music library
        catalog (see <strong>Browse</strong> below), with a menu for the
        different sections of the application, including a button for logging
        out when you are done.
        If you have not been using the application for a couple of days
        your session will be logged out and you will be asked to log back
        in to resume working with the catalog.

      <p>
        As you work with the application, it will communicate with alert
        boxes which tell you when an action you have performed has succeeded,
        or if problems were encountered (such as validation errors on a form)
        what those problems are.
        These notifications will slide off after several seconds
        (though you can select them to keep them visible longer) or
        you can dismiss them immediately using the X in the upper right
        corner of the box.

        The <strong>Browse Catalog</strong> page lets you scroll
        through the list of works contained in the music library.
        You can view the complete catalog, or you can customize the
        display using various combinations of filtering fields,
        effectively providing you with a powerful reporting tool.
        These reports can be used to answer such questions as
        <em>Which works have not been performed in the past three
        years?</em> or <em>Which items have we added to the library
        this year?</em> or <em>Which pieces are out on loan (and to
        whom)?</em>
        Reports can be generated as web HTML, displayed in your
        browser, or as an Excel spreadsheet.
        The report request form is grouped into four blocks of fields,
        each of which is collapsed when the form first appears.
        To open a block of fields, click on its label. To close an
        open block, click the label bar a second time. When your
        request is ready, click <strong>Report</strong>
        at the bottom of the form and your report will be displayed
        in a newly opened browser tab, or (if you chose to have an
        Excel report created) downloaded to your computer or mobile
        device. You can click the
        <strong>Reset</strong> button whenever you want to restore
        all the fields on the form to their default values.
        If you just want to scroll through the entire catalog without
        any filtering, you can simply click
        the <strong>Report</strong> button directly, without specifying any
        filtering options.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Options</strong> block has fields for the title
        to be displayed at the top of the report, for the report's
        format (web page or Excel spreadsheet), how the report should
        be sorted, and which columns should be displayed on the report.
        The <strong>Report Title</strong> and <strong>Report Columns</strong>
        fields are the only ones which are required (though they both have
        reasonable defaults).
        To add another column to the report, click on the <strong>Report
        Columns</strong> field and select the name of the desired column.
        This is a "typeahead" field, so you can narrow the list of displayed
        options by typing part of the name of the column you want to add.
        To control the position of the column on the report after it has
        been selected for inclusion on the report, drag its name to change
        where it will appear. The order of the report is determined by
        the values in the first column. When two or more rows on the
        report have the same value for the first column, those rows
        are ordered based on the values in the second column, and so forth.
        The <strong>Report Sorting</strong> field in this block has an option
        for specifying that the order of the report should be reversed
        (for example, to get the most recently-performed pieces at the top of
        the report).
        For the most flexibility in reporting power, chose the Excel version
        of a report so you can take advantage of Excel's filtering,
        transformation, and sorting options. Excel is also a good option
        for reports which have many columns, which can be unwieldy in
        a web table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Identification</strong> block of the form has fields
        for filtering the report based on the works' title(s),
        creators (composer, arranger, lyricist), whether they appear in
        a given collection, and what ensemble they have been arranged for.
        For the <strong>Arrangement</strong> field, you can specify
        more than one value, and works which have been arranged for any
        of those ensembles will be selected. Each of these fields has
        support for controlling the logic for that field's filtering
        using radio buttons. For example, you can say you want only those
        works whose titles contain the value you enter, or you can ask
        to exclude the works whose titles contain the value you type.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Classification</strong> block has fields for filtering
        the report based on keywords and/or tags which have been assigned
        to the works, as well as the occasions (sometimes referred to as
        "seasons") for which the work is intended to be performed (for
        example, Hanukkah or Easter or Wedding).
        Keywords are general terms (for example, "Beauty" or "Justice")
        which can be assigned to the works to assist in selecting pieces
        to fit a general theme. By contrast, category tags are grouped
        for specific purposes. For example, some of the tags are used
        to identify the performing ensemble for which the work was
        acquired ("Adult Choir" or "Handbells" for example). There are
        also tag groups for Faith Traditions, Languages, Periods, and
        Styles.
        As with the <strong>Arrangement</strong> field in the previous block,
        more than one value can be selected for a given field, and works
        which match <em>any</em> of those values will be included on
        the report. However, if values are selected for two or more
        separate fields, only those works which match at least one of
        the values in each of those fields will be included on the report.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Activity</strong> block contains fields which you
        can use to select works based on what we have done with them.
        For example, you can narrow the report to works which were
        last performed no later than (or no earlier than) a specified
        date, or which were added to the catalog no later than (earlier
        than) a given date, or which are (or are not) out on loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <strong>Item ID</strong> column is included in the report
        (as it is by default) the value in that column will be wrapped
        in a link which can be used to open a new browser tab showing
        the printable version of the full record.
        When this version is actually printed (or saved as a PDF file,
        if your browser supports that as an alternative to printing)
        the banner and menu bar are suppressed so that they do not take up
        space in the printed output.

        When you want to add a record to the catalog or modify an
        existing record, select <strong>Edit</strong> from the menu.
        At the top of the page which appears is a form you can use
        to find the record you want to modify (if that's what you're
        about to do) or to confirm that the record doesn't already exist
        if you're planning on adding it (always a good thing to check,
        so we don't end up with duplicate records, although different
        arrangements of the same musical composition should usually  get
        their own records in the catalog).
        To search for a particular record in the catalog, enter at least
        three characters in the <strong>Title</strong> field or the
        <strong>Composer Or Arranger</strong> field (or specify values
        in both fields for further narrowing the search) and click the
        <strong>Search</strong> button.
        You will see a selection of the records which contain what you
        typed in the field(s) in the corresponding portion of those
        records.
        For example, if you enter <code>flower</code> in the
        <strong>Title</strong> field and click the
        <strong>Filter</strong> button, you will see two records in
        the list at the bottom of the page (at the time of this writing):
        <em>Cantan Las Flores</em> and <em>I Got Me Flowers</em>.
        Even though "flower" does not appear in the title of the first work,
        it matches because its alternate title is <em>The Flowers Are
        Singing</em>. For another example, if you enter <code>sheep</code>
        in the <strong>Title</strong> field, and <code>bach</code> in the
        <strong>Composer Or Arranger</strong> field, Bach's <em>Sheep May
        Safely Graze</em> will be found.
        If there are more than ten records which match the filtering criteria,
        a row of controls will appear underneath the list for navigating
        through the pages of matching records.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each work listed has buttons on the right side of the page,
        appearing as icons representing their functions.
        The first button is a print button
        <span class="text-primary"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="print" class="svg-inline--fa fa-print " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M128 0C92.7 0 64 28.7 64 64l0 96 64 0 0-96 226.7 0L384 93.3l0 66.7 64 0 0-66.7c0-17-6.7-33.3-18.7-45.3L400 18.7C388 6.7 371.7 0 354.7 0L128 0zM384 352l0 32 0 64-256 0 0-64 0-16 0-16 256 0zm64 32l32 0c17.7 0 32-14.3 32-32l0-96c0-35.3-28.7-64-64-64L64 192c-35.3 0-64 28.7-64 64l0 96c0 17.7 14.3 32 32 32l32 0 0 64c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64l256 0c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64l0-64zM432 248a24 24 0 1 1 0 48 24 24 0 1 1 0-48z"></path></svg></span>
        which can be used to bring up the full record in a separate browser
        tab, as described in the <strong>Browsing</strong> section.
        You can use your browser's <strong>Print</strong> command to

        brings up the form for editing the record.
        If you hover your mouse above the title at the top of the form
        for a couple of seconds, you will see a small popup which
        displays the item number for the record you are editing.
        Normally, you will never need to know this number, but if
        you ever need to report a problem with a particular record
        to the development team, that number can be a useful piece
        of information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The editing form is organized in multiple groups of fields.
        The first four groups are for <strong>Identification</strong>
        of the work being cataloged (titles, keywords, <em>etc.</em>),
        <strong>Creation</strong> (composer, arranger, lyricist),
        <strong>Publication</strong> (publisher, supplier, copyright
        information, and stock number), and <strong>Musical
        Information</strong> (key, time signature, accompaniment,
        arrangement, level of difficulty, <em>etc.</em>). The other
        four groups are for repeatable blocks of information:
        <strong>Performances</strong> (when performed, comments about
        the performance), <strong>Inventories</strong> (how many copies,
        when the inventory was taken, the location and condition of the copies,
        <em>etc.</em>), <strong>Parts</strong> (for works with orchestral
        accompaniment), and <strong>Loans</strong> (when and to whom was
        the work loaned, when was it returned, <em>etc.</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        When the form is first displayed, all of the eight groups are
        collapsed to make it easier to navigate to the part(s) of the
        form with which you need to work. To open a section, click on
        its title. To collapse an opened section, click on its title
        again. In the repeatable groups, each of the instances is
        contained in a nested collapsed set of fields, which can be
        opened and closed in the same way as the enclosing group.
        Each of the repeating groups has a button for adding a new
        instance, and each instance has a button at the far right of
        its title bar for removing that instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fields on the editing form are of different types, most
        of which will be familiar, such as plain text fields (for
        example, the title fields), dropdown picklists (from which
        you select a value from a set of valid values), date fields
        (which provide an interface which makes it easy to select
        a date), or a checkbox (for indicating that the item being
        cataloged is actually a collection of individual works, each
        of which can get its own catalog record). For the person
        (composer, arranger, lyricist) and company (publisher,
        supplier) picklists, you can start typing and the selections
        shown in the dropdown list will be restricted to those which match
        what you have typed so far, even if what you typed appears
        in the middle of a value instead of at the beginning, making
        it easier to find specific values in these very long lists,
        which contain hundreds of values. If you discover that the
        person or company which you need to select for a work is not
        available on the picklist you can add the person or company
        without leaving your editing form by clicking on the <strong>Add
        Person</strong> or <strong>Add Company</strong> button at the
        bottom of the page. A popup overlays the editing form. Fill
        in at least the required fields, click the <strong>Add Record</strong>
        button, and the new value will appear in your picklist in the
        main editing form.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have finished editing the record for the work,
        click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the page
        (or <strong>Cancel</strong> if you want to abandon any editing
        you have done and return to the <strong>Catalog Search</strong>
        page). If there are any validation errors found on the form
        when you try to save it, correct them and click the
        <strong>Save</strong> button again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final button
        <span class="text-danger"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="trash" class="svg-inline--fa fa-trash " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M135.2 17.7L128 32 32 32C14.3 32 0 46.3 0 64S14.3 96 32 96l384 0c17.7 0 32-14.3 32-32s-14.3-32-32-32l-96 0-7.2-14.3C307.4 6.8 296.3 0 284.2 0L163.8 0c-12.1 0-23.2 6.8-28.6 17.7zM416 128L32 128 53.2 467c1.6 25.3 22.6 45 47.9 45l245.8 0c25.3 0 46.3-19.7 47.9-45L416 128z"></path></svg></span>
        on each line of the list of records in the <strong>Search</strong>
        results is for deleting the record.
        That button will be absent if the record is for a collection
        which is referenced by other records representing works contained
        in that collection, because you cannot delete such a record
        while any other records depend on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a new record, click the <strong>Create</strong> button
        underneath the search form.
        The form for creating a new record is the same form used for
        editing an existing record.

        All of the sets of values used for the picklists on the main
        editing form can be edited to add new values, as well as edit
        or remove existing values. In many cases, the order in which
        each value appears on its picklist can also be controlled.
        For accounts with permission to edit the catalog, a menu
        item labeled <strong>Manage Lookup Tables</strong> will be
        present. Clicking on that menu item opens a submenu from
        which you can select which value set you wish to edit.
        A form with a single picklist is then displayed, containing the
        names of the values currently present in the set. For those
        lookup sets which support overriding the default sort order
        which would result from alphabetical ordering, the sort position
        is also shown for each value on the list. Select an existing
        value to edit and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button, or
        click the <strong>Create</strong> button if you need to add a value
        which is not already in this set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perform the editing of the value's fields and click the
        <strong>Save</strong> button. If any validation errors
        are found, correct them and try again. For values which
        are used by the catalog's main item records, a count
        of how many records use this value is displayed at the
        top of the editing form for the value. Such values cannot
        be deleted from the list unless all of those uses are
        removed from the catalog records. If a value has no records
        which use it, a <strong>Delete</strong> button will appear
        below the editing form, so you can remove the value from the
        list if you believe it will no longer be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Tag Groups</strong> set of values is not used
        directly by the main catalog records, but is instead used
        to associate the <strong>Tag</strong> values to a specific
        category group. These categories can also be edited or added,
        though as with the other value sets, a tag group cannot

        The <strong>Accounts</strong> page lists all of the user login
        accounts in the system, showing the account name, the user's
        full name, the password, the user's role (editor, viewer, or
        administrator), whether the account is still active or has
        been retired, and a comment describing the account.
        The row for each account is clickable, bringing up a form
        for editing the account's information. There is also
        a <strong>Create Account</strong> button above the list
        of existing accounts for adding new users to the system.
        When creating a new account, be sure to uncheck the *Read Only*
        checkbox if the user of the account should be able to edit
        the catalog records.

      <p>
        The account records are the one type of record which cannot
        be removed, because that would lose information for the
        audit trail. If you find that you have created an account
        by mistake, and the account has never been used, mark the
        account as inactive, with a note explaining what happened,
        and then re-use that account record the next time a new
        user needs to be added to the system. But first look at
        the <strong>Audit Trail</strong> (see the next section
        of this manual) to make sure that the account really has
        never been used before recycling it.

        The <strong>Audit Trail</strong> page shows the history of all
        user activity resulting in modifications to the catalog data.
        This is occasionally useful when a user reports that the software
        is not behaving as expected. The system doesn't capture all the
        information needed to reconstruct each version of each record,
        but it does capture the basic information about each addition,
        modification, or deletion (who, what, when, which record, which table).
        The events are displayed in reverse chronological order (that is,
        newest activity at the top).
